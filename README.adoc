## RC-BLE

Firmware for BLE-based RC receiver for miniature RC vehicles.

The board is based on nRF52810 MCU.

More details about the project: https://positron96.gitlab.io/projects/rc-ble/

The project uses PlatformIO build system,
 which in turn uses custom platform and framework based on Nordic nRF5 SDK.
PlatformIO will download these components automatically,
 but here are the links to the projects anyway:
 https://github.com/positron96/platform-nordicnrf52,
 https://github.com/positron96/framework-nrf5sdk.

The firmware supports OTA updates.
For this the MCU needs to have a bootloader flashed,
 so there are 3 components in the flash: SoftDevice, Bootloader and this firmware.

Example "open_bootloader" from the SDK
 (version adapter for platformIO is in platform repository)
 was used.
Instructions for flashing will come later.

## Controllers for this firmware

This project is not compatible with typical RC remotes (due to using BLE),
 so it requires its own remote.

At the moment there are possible options:\

 * Android application created with MIT App Inventor.
   Currently no way to provide link to AppInventor project.
 * Hardware remote that uses ESP3.
   Firmware is hosted here: https://github.com/positron96/rc-ble-transmitter.
   Hardware is DIY, but will eventually be a dedicated 3D-printed remote.
 * (Experimental) Web Bluetooth controller.
   Should work on a lot of smartphones without the need to install anything.   
   Launch it from here: https://positron96.github.io/rc-ble/.
   Source is in link:webtx[this folder].

### Communication protocol

Communication is via UART-like interface over BLE.
At the moment, UUIDs of Nordic UART Service (NUS) are used:

* `6E400001-B5A3-F393-E0A9-E50E24DCCA9E` is service UUID
* `6E400002-B5A3-F393-E0A9-E50E24DCCA9E` is RX charachteristic UUID. This is tha main channel to communicate with FW, send data to this charachteristic.
* `6E400003-B5A3-F393-E0A9-E50E24DCCA9E` is TX charachteristic UUID (not used at the moment)

Basic commands follow typical RC protocols that simply contain values for each control channel.
These commands are separated by newline ("`\n`").

.Commands table
[cols="1a,2a"]
|===
|Command|Description
|`N=V`
| Set channel N to value V (uint8, center position is 128).
So far there are 3 channels: 0=throttle, 1=steering, 2=headlights, 3=marker lights.
| `!dfu` | Reboot into DFU mode (see below).
| `!trim_steer=N` | Change center value of steer servo to Nus
| `!invert_drive=0` or `invert_drive=1` | Whether to invert drive direction.
